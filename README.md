# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI Manager

This Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI Manager is a web application designed for managing user roles, permissions, and access control in a secure and efficient manner. Administrators can easily create and manage roles, assign them to users, and control access to various resources based on the defined roles.

## Features

- **Role Management:** Create, update, and delete roles.
- **User Management:** Assign roles to users and manage user-specific access.
- **Permission Management:** Define specific permissions and associate them with roles.
- **Dynamic UI:** The user interface adapts based on the roles and permissions assigned to the user.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Integration Support:** Can be integrated into other applications for role-based access management.

## Configuration

### Customizing Roles and Permissions

- **Roles:** Roles can be created, updated, or deleted. Each role can have specific permissions associated with it.
- **Permissions:** Permissions define what a user can or cannot do within the system. These can be assigned to roles.
- **Users:** Users can be assigned to one or more roles to define their access level.

### Tailwind CSS

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, which makes it easy to customize the UI to fit your specific needs. Modify the configuration files or the styles directly as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **React** for building the UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling.
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server.
- **TypeScript** for static typing and code quality.
- **ESLint** for linting and enforcing coding standards.
